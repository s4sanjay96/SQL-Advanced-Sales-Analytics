## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end SQL-based data analytics solution for a retail business.

The objective was to perform advanced business analysis using SQL Server.

The project applies advanced SQL techniques such as **Window Functions, CTEs, Running Totals, Moving Averages, Revenue Contribution Analysis, Year-over-Year (YoY) comparisons, and Customer Segmentation** to generate actionable business insights.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

The retail company aims to:

- Track sales performance over time  
- Identify high-performing products and categories  
- Understand customer purchasing behavior  
- Measure revenue contribution across segments  
- Build analytical reporting views for business intelligence  

This project addresses these challenges by structuring raw data into a scalable warehouse model and performing deep SQL-driven analysis.

---

## 🏗 Data Architecture

The project follows a **Star Schema Data Warehouse design**.

### Fact Table
- `fact_sales` → Stores transactional sales data

### Dimension Tables
- `dim_customers`
- `dim_products`

### Analytical Layer
- `gold` schema used for reporting views

This architecture enables scalable reporting, simplified joins, and optimized analytical queries.

### 4️⃣ Customer Segmentation

Customers classified into:

- **VIP** → Long-term high spenders  
- **Regular** → Consistent moderate spenders  
- **New** → Recently acquired customers  

**Business Impact:**  
Enables targeted marketing strategies and customer retention planning.

---

### 5️⃣ Year-over-Year (YoY) & Month-over-Month (MoM) Analysis

- Used `LAG()` window function to compare historical performance.
- Identified product-level and customer-level performance shifts.

**Business Impact:**  
Supports performance benchmarking and strategic adjustments.
